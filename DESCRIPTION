Description: Contains functions performing hybrid monitoring for energy consumption data through Monte Carlo sampling. Currently, the package implements the multivariate hybrid monitoring of monthly consumption data modeled as a multivariate normal random sample. For maximal computational efficiency, the multiplicity corrections are rewritten in C++ and many for loops deploy parallel computing via OpenMP.
